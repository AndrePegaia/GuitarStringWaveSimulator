# GuitarWaveSimulator
Guitar wave simulation attempt using matplotlib and audio recreation using scipy.io.

This program uses a simplified form of the wave equation to try to simulate the sound wave of a guitar note, generating both a .gif from matplotlib and a .wav file from scipy.io.
The files are stored in the folders "GIFs" and "WAVs".
